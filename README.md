## How To Play
You will have 6 attempts to guess a randomly chosen 5 letter word. If you guess an invalid word (too long/short, not containing 5 valid letters, or not in the valid word list), you will not be penalized a guess attempt. If your guess is correct, you win. Otherwise, the program will show one of three options on each letter in your guess: green, yellow, or grey. Green means that the letter in your guess is in the word and in the correct position. Yellow means that the letter in your guess is in the word but in the incorrect position. Grey means that the letter in your guess is not in the word at all. If you use all 6 guesses, you lose and the program will show you the correct word. Upon completion, regardless of win or lose, you will be asked if you would like to play again.
